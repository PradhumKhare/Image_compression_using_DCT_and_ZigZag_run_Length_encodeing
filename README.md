# Image_compression_using_DCT_and_ZigZag_run_Length_encodeing
This model is build on python using Numpy and Quantization Matrix 
The model encode the image in a text document using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and ZigZag run length encoding
The model Decodes the encoded image using inverse DCT and inverse of zigzag run length encoding
